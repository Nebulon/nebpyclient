Overview
--------

The Nebulon Python SDK is a client library for nebulon ON written in
Python 3. It allows working with Nebulon nPods just like with the nebulon
ON web user interface but in a scriptable form.

As an alternative to using the Python SDK, customers can chose to use
GraphQL natively to interact with nebulon ON. This project is merely
a wrapper around the nebulon ON GraphQL API. For specifics on nebulon
resources and architecture, consult the Ultimate Guide to Cloud-Defined
Storage.

This documentation should be supplemental and attempts to explain the
installation procedure of the SDK, getting started with the SDK, and
provides details of teh exposed APIs.
